# growintandem
Submission for the grow in Tandem apprentice interview challenge

Note: Normally, I would separate the front-end and back-end into two separate repos but I'll just combine them for easy of downlading

##Stack:

Frontend: JavaScript React.js (w/ create-react-app)

Backend: Kotlin Vert.x

Data Source: I'm planning on having a persistent file as a data store, but I'll use dependency injection with Koin.io so you could just as easily swap out the ObjectRepo implementation for storing to a file to one that leverages a database if you wanted to
